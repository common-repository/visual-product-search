== Description ==

Visual Search is a technique to use an image as a query rather than text and search for identical or visually similar images within a given product image collection or inventory. Accelx visual product search module deploys sophisticated AI technology, which can identify close to 94% top-5 accurate identical or similar product images.

Once the visual search module is installed and configured into ecommerce website, a special icon   called "Visual Search Icon" should appear in the Search Bar. A new search window will appear when you click on the visual search icon. This new visual search window enables customers to visually search products in ecommerce site in 4 different methods as described below.

Method 1: Search product using image file as an input. Using "Upload an Image " Tab on the visual search window, a customer can browse & upload a product image, and search identical or similar products in ecommerce site by clicking on the Visual Search icon.

Method 2: Search product using image URL. Using "Paste Image URL" Tab on the visual search window, a customer can paste product image link copied from other websites, and search for identical or similar products in ecommerce site by clicking on the Visual Search icon.

Method 3: Product search by clicking images on the Suggested Product pan. A customer can search identical and similar products by clicking images displayed on the suggested product pan of the visual search window.
